# CuLPy
An ecological model for bottom-up regulated shallow aquatic ecosystems - the Curonian Lagoon - in Python.

CulPy includes total of 11 state vaiables, including 10 abiotic state variables as particulate forms (C,N,P), dissolved forms (C,N,P), nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, and dissolved oxygen, and 1 living compartment as phytoplankton carbon. \
It covers essential biogeochemical processes (e.g. decomposition, mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, phytoplankton uptake, rearetion). 

To run the model for 0-dimentional configuration please use "CuLPy-0D.py", and\
"CuLPy.py" for 1-dimentional configuration.
